                <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: large; text-align: justify;">Online banking, also known as internet banking, is a service that allows customers to conduct financial transactions over the internet. This service provides a convenient way to manage bank accounts and perform various banking activities without the need to visit a physical branch. Users can access their accounts through a web browser or a mobile app, enabling them to check balances, review transaction history, transfer funds, pay bills, and even deposit checks remotely.

                    Online banking platforms are designed with advanced security measures to protect usersâ€™ financial information, including encryption and multi-factor authentication. These platforms often offer additional features such as budgeting tools, spending trackers, and financial goal-setting options. Many online banks also provide competitive interest rates and lower fees compared to traditional banks, as they save on the costs associated with maintaining physical branches.
                    
                    Overall, online banking has revolutionized the way people manage their finances, offering a blend of convenience, accessibility, and enhanced financial management tools
